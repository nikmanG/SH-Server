## 0.0.1 [[VIDEO]](https://youtu.be/Zsqq53stDzQ)
**Current State**: glorified chat app with command abilities.

**Notes**: 
- this was mostly setup stuff. Getting the project together mainly, next steps will be more about actual game design... I hope.

## 0.0.2
**Current State**:

**Notes**: 
- One major delivery change was to emphasise that the server is really only logic so will send JSON instead of strings back to client, and let client do rendering.
- Still it isn't really a _game_. While it will have commands and majority of the abilities, there is still a lack of order.
- Need to add checks for special actions to make sure they are being performed at correct times.
